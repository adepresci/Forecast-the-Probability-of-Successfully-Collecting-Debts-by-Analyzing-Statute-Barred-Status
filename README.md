In the realm of debt collection, the ability to discern which accounts are statute-barred—thus potentially unrecoverable—holds immense significance. This project endeavors to develop a sophisticated machine-learning model aimed at accurately predicting the probability of successfully collecting debts by meticulously examining the statute-barred status of each account.
Given a dataset encompassing a multitude of attributes including original creditor information, account IDs, current balances, purchase dates, and a wealth of other pertinent features, the objective is to construct a predictive model that excels in identifying accounts where the statute barred status may influence the likelihood of debt retrieval.
The focal point of this endeavor centers on the IsStatBarred field ‘Y’ status, which serves as the pivotal target variable for classification.
